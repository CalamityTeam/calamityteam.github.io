# Calamity Dev Newsletter: Christmas 2025

<cite>Written by CDMusic, edited/revised by Ozzatron + jasper</cite>

<h2 class="text-center">A Year of Calamity, and an Impending Storm</h2>

Hiya folks!

With Christmas now behind us and the new year ahead, what better time to look back on the past year of Calamity?

## 2025: A Tumultuous Year

<blockquote class="quote-center">
There's no better way to say it: <strong>2025 has been a tumultuous and rocky year for Calamity</strong>.
</blockquote>

This year saw numerous substantial changes to the team's membership and organization:

<a class="">
<ul>
  <li>A handful of new developers joined.</li>
  <li>Several past developers returned after long absences.</li>
  <li>Most significantly, <i>Calamity saw a change in leadership</i>.</li>
</ul>
</a>

**Ozzatron** has taken ownership of the Calamity brand and now holds a management position over the development team and business affairs. Fabsol has resigned from any positions previously held and is no longer associated with the development team.

The change in leadership caused the team to spend significant time re-evaluating our design and content priorities, particularly regarding in-game boss fights. Our team methodologies have been changing dramatically as we adjust to the new working environment.

<div class="divider-text">
  <span>SUNKEN SEA OVERHAUL</span>
</div>

The long-awaited **Sunken Sea Overhaul** has been looming over our heads. Gradual progress has been made with our art team working to perfect the shared vision for this currently lackluster biome.

This update has been in the works for a very long time and has undergone **numerous visual and design revisions** as recently as this month. Our goal remains to:

<a>
<ol>
  <li>Make the Sunken Sea <strong>aesthetically pleasing and cohesive</strong>.</li>
  <li>Provide a <strong>fulfilling and worthwhile gameplay experience</strong> for players throughout pre-Hardmode and Hardmode.</li>
</ol>
</a>

</figure>

<a>It is no secret that development of the Sunken Sea Overhaul has been far from smooth sailing</a> (no pun intended). We still cannot give a release date with confidence, but expect it to be **some time in 2026**.

  <span>UPCOMING UPDATE</span>

<h2 class="text-center">Version 2.1 - "Brainstorm"</h2>
<p class="text-center"><i>Icon sprited by Dia.</i></p>

<p class="text-center">
In the meantime, the team has a <strong>staggeringly huge amount of unreleased changes:</strong>
</p>

<a class="text-center">
<ul>
  <p>Item and boss reworks.</p>
  <p>Visual improvements.</p>
  <p>Numerous bug fixes.</p>
</ul>
</a>

<p class="text-center">
Due to the <i>massive time gap</i> since our last major update <a href="https://youtu.be/R9wYNI5y7bw">(Bountiful Harvest)</a>, we've decided to adjust our strategy.
</p>

<blockquote class="quote-center">
<h1><strong>Calamity will be seeing a major update, Version 2.1 “Brainstorm”, relatively soon.</strong></h1>
If all goes well, Brainstorm will be released some time in <strong>January / February 2026</strong>.

This update will contain all of the **non-Sunken Sea related content** that would have been part of the Sunken Sea Overhaul.

  <strong>Please note:</strong> This update will <strong>not</strong> include the Sunken Sea Overhaul, which will come later as part of a separate update.

Remember that Calamity's team is _entirely made up of volunteers_. We all have our own lives, jobs, education, and other responsibilities. A lot of valuable time and attention has been sunk into the project, but Calamity's direction will always belong to the devs.

## _Before we go..._

  <figcaption>Welcome to the plushie realm!</figcaption>
</figure>

Lastly, we'd like to **thank you for the amazing support** on the Draedon and Signus plushie campaign in collaboration with Makeship. The community response has been phenomenal, and we're all very excited for you to receive your plushies in **Spring 2026**.

<div class="callout">
<h1 class="text-center">Remember!</h1>
<div class="text-center">
The plushies are still available until <strong>January 2nd, 2026</strong>, so you can still snag them last minute!

### Why a Newsletter?

Some members of the team wanted another outlet to be more open with the community. Transparency is something we find very important for a dev team to have on a project like this.

Going forward, we want to make sure that, regardless of the surprises we want to keep for players, the team gives some insight into the process that goes into making Calamity.

# Thank You!

If you've read all the way down here, thank you! We appreciate you taking your time to read through this very first newsletter.

Ideally, expect the next newsletter **after the release of both Brainstorm and Terraria 1.4.5** - writing that should be fun.

Have a _Happy New Year_, and see you soon!
