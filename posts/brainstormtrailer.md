A big thank you goes out to <i>moonburn and Bravioli</i> for the editing, <i>moonburn and <span class="musician-entry musician-entry-inline">

# To answer some last minute questions... 

<span class="badge badge-primary">Question:</span> <i>Will Brainstorm be on 1.4.5?</i>
<br />
<span class="badge badge-danger">Answer:</span> <b>No.</b> Brainstorm will be on the <b>1.4.4 version of tModLoader</b>. We will be porting to 1.4.5 at a later date in a <i>separate update</i> after tModLoader itself has finished porting over to Bigger & Boulder..

<div class="divider"></div>
<span class="badge badge-primary">Question:</span> <i>Is the giant DoG re-sprite coming in Brainstorm?</i>
<br />
<span class="badge badge-danger">Answer:</span> <b>No.</b> After extensive team discussions, we made the decision to <b>not</b> move ahead with the sprite created by <span class="musician-entry musician-entry-inline">
  <img

    alt="Tyeski"
    class="musician-avatar"
  />
</span> <a href="https://youtube.com/@heartplusup" class="musician-name">Heart Plus Up!</a>. While this may come as a <i>huge</i> disappointment, we determined that designing a high-quality fight around a sprite that large would simply not be feasible. <i>The team vastly preferred releasing a good, regular-sized Devourer of Gods rather than a colossal, mediocre one.</i>


<div class="divider"></div>
<span class="badge badge-primary">Question:</span> <i>Will I have to create a new world for a Brainstorm playthrough?</i>
<br />
<span class="badge badge-warning">Answer:</span> <b>Not necessarily.</b> Old worlds will be playable without issues, but you will be missing out on the revamped Draedon Lab generation and some lovely additions and reworks to earlier parts of the game.



<h2> That's all! </h2>
